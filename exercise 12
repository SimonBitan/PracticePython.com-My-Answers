### Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
### For practice, write this code inside a function.

import random

def firstlast(input_list):
    result_list = [input_list[0], input_list[-1]]
    return(result_list)

listlength = random.randint(3,5)
a = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(listlength)]
print("This is the randomly generated list: " + str(a))

result = firstlast(a)
print("Here are the first and last elements of that list: " + str(result))
