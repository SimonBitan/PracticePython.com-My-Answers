### Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). 
# Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.

import random

while True:

    random_num = random.randint(1, 9)
    guess_count = 0

    while True:

        print("I'm thinking of a number between (and including) 1 and 9.")

        guess = int(input("Guess what it is: "))

        if random_num == guess:
            print("Ah, you guessed my number!")
            guess_count = guess_count + 1
            break
        elif guess > random_num:
            print("You guessed too high! Try again.")
            guess_count = guess_count + 1
        elif guess < random_num:
            print("You guessed too low! Try again.")
            guess_count = guess_count + 1

    print("Well done. You got the answer in " + str(guess_count) + " guess(es).")
   
### Extras

# 1. Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
    keep_playing = input("Would you like to continue playing? Type anything if yes, 'exit' if no. ")

    if keep_playing.lower() == "exit":
        break

# 2. Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
# *** Simon's note: added into original exercise.
