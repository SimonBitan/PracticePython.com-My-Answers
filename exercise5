### Take two lists, say for example these two:

# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
c = []

for element1 in a:
    for element2 in b:
        if element1 == element2:
            if element1 not in c:
                c.append(element1)

print(c)

### Extras

# 1.Randomly generate two lists to test this
import random

length_list1 = random.randint(1,15)
length_list2 = random.randint(1,15)

random_list1 = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(length_list1)]
random_list2 = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(length_list2)]
random_list3 = []

print("This is the first random list: " + str(random_list1))
print("This is the secondd random list: " + str(random_list2))

for element3 in random_list1:
    for element4 in random_list2: 
        if element3 == element4:
            if element3 not in random_list3:
                random_list3.append(element3)
                
print("These are the numbers that both random lists share: " + str(random_list3))

# 2. Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)

# ***Simon's note: I'm assuming they mean the original exercise when they say "this".
# *The random one seems extraordinarily complex if not impossible for a beginner to make into one line.

print([element for element in a if element in b][1:])
