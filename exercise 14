### Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

## Extras:

## Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.

import random

list_length = 5
random_list = [random.randint(1,5) for _ in range(list_length)]

print("This is the randomly generated list: " + str(random_list))

# Set
def remove_duplicates_set(list_input):
    new_list = list(set(list_input))

    return new_list

no_duplicates_set = remove_duplicates_set(random_list)

print("This is the list without duplicates, using sets: " + str(no_duplicates_set))

# Loop

def remove_duplicates_loop(list_input):
    newlist = []

    for element in list_input:
        if element not in newlist:
            newlist.append(element)

    return newlist

no_duplicates_loop = remove_duplicates_loop(random_list)

print("This is the list without duplicates, using a for loop: " + str(no_duplicates_loop))

## Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function. Exercise 5 copied below.

### Take two lists, say for example these two:

# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

print("This is list a: " + str(a))
print("This is list b: " + str(b))

def remove_duplicates_from_two_lists(list_a, list_b):
    c = []

    for element_a in list_a:
        for element_b in list_b:
            if element_a == element_b:
                c.append(element_a)

    c = list(set(c))
    return c

c = remove_duplicates_from_two_lists(a, b)

print("These are the numbers found in both lists: " + str(c))
