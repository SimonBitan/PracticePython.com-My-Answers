### Take a list, say for example this one:

# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

print("This is the list: ")
print(a)
print("\n")

for index, element in enumerate(a):
    if element < 5:
        print(f"Element {element} at index {index} is less than 5.\n")

print("The rest of the elements in the list are greater than 5.")

### Extras

# 1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.

b = []

for index, element in enumerate(a):
    if element < 5:
        b.append(element)

print("Here is a list of all elements less than 5 in the original list:")
print(b)

# 2. Write this in one line of Python.

print("This is one line of code in python :", [element for element in a if element < 5])

# 3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

c = []

for index, element in enumerate(a):
    if element < number:
        c.append(element)

print("These numbers in the original list are less than " + str(number) + ": " + str(c))
