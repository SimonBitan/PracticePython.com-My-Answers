### Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

  # My name is Michele

### Then I would see the string:

  # Michele is name My

### shown back to me.

def string_in_reverse(string):
    split_string = string.split()
    reversed_string = " ".join(reversed(split_string))

    return reversed_string

phrase = input("Please provide a long string containing multiple words: ")

reversed_phrase = string_in_reverse(phrase)

print("This is your input in reverse order of words: " + str(reversed_phrase))
