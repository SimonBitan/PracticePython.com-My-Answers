### Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 

number = int(input("Type a number: "))

potential_divisors = list(range(number + 1))

potential_divisors.pop(0)

divisors = []

for index, element in enumerate(potential_divisors):
    if number % element == 0:
        divisors.append(element)

print("The following are the divisors of " + str(number) + ": " + str(divisors))
