### Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This number is even!")
else:
    print("This number is odd!")

### Extras

# 1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
    
if number % 4 == 0:
    print("Woah! This number is also a multiple of 4!")

# 2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. 
# If not, print a different appropriate message.

num = int(input("Give me a number to check: "))
check = int(input("Now, give me a number to divide the checked number by:"))

if num % check == 0:
    print("The second number divides equally into the first.")
else:
    print("The second number does not divide equally into the first.")
