### Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
# *** Simon's note: two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors with each person giving an input seems like a waste of time. Anyone can do that with another player without a program. 
# * Instead, I've made a program where it's a player vs the computer that gives a random input.
