### This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.

# Take two lists, say for example these two:

	# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this using at least one list comprehension.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

print("This is list 'a': " + str(a))
print("This is list 'b': " + str(b))

c = list(set([element for element in a if element in b])) ### Turn into a set before list to remove duplicates.

print("These are the numbers common to both lists: " + str(c))

### Extra: Randomly generate two lists to test this

import random

length_list1 = random.randint(1, 15)
length_list2 = random.randint(1, 15)

randomlist_a = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(length_list1)]
randomlist_b = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(length_list2)]
randomlist_c = list(set([element for element in randomlist_a if element in randomlist_b])) ### Turn into a set before list to remove duplicates.

print("This is the first randomly generated list: " + str(randomlist_a))
print("This is the second randomly generated list: " + str(randomlist_b))

print("These are the numbers both lists have in common: " + str(randomlist_c))
