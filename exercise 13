### Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. 
### Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.

def fibonacci(n):
    fibonacci_sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1

    for _ in range(n):
        fibonacci_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b

    return fibonacci_sequence

number = int(input("Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate: "))

fibonacci_numbers = fibonacci(number)

print(f"The first {number} Fibonacci numbers are {fibonacci_numbers}.")
