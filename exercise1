### Exercise 1: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

name = input("What is your name?\n")

age = int(input("Hi " + name + "! How old are you going to be by the end of this year?\n"))

current_year = int(input("Mind telling me what the current year is? I'm just a robot. I don't know =)\n"))

one_hundred = current_year - age + 100

original = name + ", you will turn 100 in the year " + str(one_hundred) + ". "

print(original)

### Extras:

# 1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message.

copies = int(input("Now give me a number, and I'll print out that many copies of the previous message.\n"))

print(copies * original)

# 2. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.

print((original + "\n") * copies)
